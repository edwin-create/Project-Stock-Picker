Stock Picker


stock_picker is a Ruby method that, given an array of stock prices (one price per day), returns the pair of days on which you should buy and then sell to maximize profit. The method must follow the rules:

You must buy before you sell (i.e. the buy-day index must be less than the sell-day index).

You should handle edge cases, such as when the lowest price occurs on the last day, or the highest price is on the first day.

Days are indexed starting at 0.# Project-Stock-Picker
